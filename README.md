The **Harmonics Calculator** is a web-based application designed to help users calculate and visualize the harmonic frequencies and their corresponding properties based on a given transmission frequency.

</div>

## Features

- **Interactive Frequency Input**: Enter a transmission frequency (in MHz) to calculate harmonics up to the 10th order.
- **Harmonics Table**: View a detailed table showing:
  - Harmonic frequencies
  - Wavelength (λ)
  - Mechanical lengths (ML, ML/2, ML/4) considering a shorting factor (k=0.95).
- **Dynamic Chart Visualization**: See harmonic frequencies plotted on a responsive chart for easy interpretation.
- **Modern UI Design**: A clean, responsive interface with a dark theme for an enhanced user experience.

## How It Works

1. Enter a frequency in the input field (e.g., 14.200 MHz).
2. The app calculates:
   - Harmonic frequencies (1st to 10th order).
   - Wavelength (λ) and mechanical lengths (ML, ML/2, ML/4).
3. Results are displayed in a table and visualized on a dynamic chart.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure and content.
- **CSS3**: Styling and layout design.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Core functionality.
- **Chart.js**: Interactive charts for data visualization.
